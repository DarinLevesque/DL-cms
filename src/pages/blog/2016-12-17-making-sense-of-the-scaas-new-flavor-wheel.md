## The Beginning

I grew up in a relatively small New England seacoast town. I played hockey, was on a swim team, and eventually went to private boarding school. My family was tight-knit. I recall frequently hearing my mother say, "Levesque's root for Levesque's," as she coached my sister and me on how to overcome life's challenges.

During my teenage years, I often felt frustrated that despite my hard work and full attention, I was always in someone else's shadow. At first it was my Father because he seemed to have all the answers; He was wise and calculated. Many of my curiosities were myth-busted by him. I felt inadequate and behind in "getting it."

Then it was my sister.
